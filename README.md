## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This project is part of my journey to understand and build real-world applications using Vector Databases. It covers:

- What embeddings are and how they work  
- How to store and retrieve documents based on semantic similarity  
- Building a user-friendly interface to interact with vector data  
- Using tools like `LangChain` for chaining logic and interactions (optional)

## ✅ To-Do

- [x] Basic ChromaDB integration  
- [x] OpenAI Embedding setup  
- [x] Streamlit search UI  
- [ ] Multi-document ingestion  
- [ ] Metadata filtering  
- [ ] LangChain-powered Q&A interface
